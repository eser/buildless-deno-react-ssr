This is a React starter/boilerplate project. Comparing to its alternatives, it
completely works [buildless](https://buildless.site/) with the power of
[Deno](https://deno.land/) and [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).

_This project is currently in early stages of its development. Descriptions or
instructions are not mature yet as well as the project itself._
