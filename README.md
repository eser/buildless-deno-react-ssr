# ✖️ [buildless-deno-react-ssr](https://github.com/eserozvataf/buildless-deno-react-ssr)

This is a React starter/boilerplate project. Comparing to its alternatives, it
completely works [buildless](https://buildless.site/) with the power of
[Deno](https://deno.land/) and [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).

You can see the latest running version of the code deployed on deno.dev at
[buildless-deno-react-ssr.deno.dev](https://buildless-deno-react-ssr.deno.dev/).

_This project is currently in early stages of its development. Descriptions or
instructions are not mature yet as well as the project itself._


## Features
- Doesn't require any transpilation / compiler process! (no more babel or typescript compiler!)
- There's no bundles generated (no more webpack!)
- Both backend and frontend shares the same files.
- Works with Deno and any runtime supports ES Modules natively.


## Quick start

Ensure that `Deno` is installed on your system first.

Clone this git repo
`git clone https://github.com/eserozvataf/buildless-deno-react-ssr.git` - and
checkout the
[tagged release](https://github.com/eserozvataf/buildless-deno-react-ssr/releases)
you'd like to use.

Then run the server,

```sh
$ deno task start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.
